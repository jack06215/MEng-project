This is a demo for "Simultaneous Vanishing Point Detection and Camera Calibration from Single Images".

getLine.m is a Matlab m-file that detects line segments in a given image.
demo_final.m is a Matlab m-file that the algortithm proposed in our paper. 

This demo is implemented in Matlab 2009b, Windows 7. 
Put these two m-files in one folder and open demo_final.m in Matlab. Press F5 to run the demo.
Some images are provided with this demo. To test different images, change the file path in the imread() function in Line 5. 
	f = imread('<file path>');

Notice that our algorithm is based on the constraints provided by three orthogonal vanishing points. So there should be three significant orthogonal vanishing points in your test image.
