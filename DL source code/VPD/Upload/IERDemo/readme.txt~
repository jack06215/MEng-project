This is the code for our vanishing point detection algorithm. 

******Please cite the paper if you use it.*******

Use the code at your own risk. 

This is a protected M-file version of my research code. If you want the source code or if you find bugs in it, please contact Bo Li. 

The code has been tested under Ubuntu Linux 9.04 with Matlab 2009a and opencv 1.1, with gcc 4.3.

demo.m provides an example of how to use the code.
